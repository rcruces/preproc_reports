    "# Gradient\n",
    "\n",
    "At a vertex v, vertical gradient was computed as the difference in normalized intensity between corresponding vertices above and below v on neighboring surfaces, divided by their distance. Horizontal gradient was computed as mean intensity difference between v and its immediate surface neighbors, divided by the mean distance between v and its neighbors. Values at the GM–CSF surface were not considered. Decreased vertical/horizontal gradients within cortical surfaces were interpreted as proxies for radial/tangential dyslamination. Decreased vertical gradient at the GM–WM interface modeled blurring.\n",
